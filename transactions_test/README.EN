Example of usage BerkeleyDb library for D.

In the directory there is 2 programms: reader.d and writer.d
It is example of working transaction system of BerkeleyDb.
To build you need change path to BerkeleyDb sources in the config.sh.
The BerkeleyDb sourecs must be built. To build BDB enough in the build_unix
directry run:
$ ../dist/configure
$ make
After that you can build reader&writer programms:
$ ./build.sh

reader open transaction, and for 5 seconds reads 5 times the number from the
database and print it to console, closes the transaction and the loop repeats 
again.
writer opens transaction and in series writes to the DB on the place of 
the number values from 1 to 10, after that the transaction closes and after
a second the loop repeats with numbers from 11 to 20 and so on.

At the first you need run reader, after that (without stopping reader)
in another console writer.

As result reader never reads numbers not divisible by 10, so as all numbers
writes in one transaction of writer. But also so as 5 seconds reader is in
one transaction, it skips 50 changes of the number value. So on screen
you will see e.g. 5 running numbers 20, after that 70, 120, 170...
